      <img src="assets/images/me.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Michael Faulkner">

      <p>I have recently began the journey of completing UCF's Boot Camp for Full Stack Web Development, in an arduous 12-week curriculum.  I began this journey while in college, when I briefly started coding and learned to enjoy it, as I earned a minor in Management Informaiton Systems.  While the majority of my time was previously spent in law enforcement and other jobs, I always maintianed an interest into continuing coding.  I look forward to graduating and completing the curriculum, at which point I hope to continue with a successful career using the skills learned.</p>
                
      <p>I am the proud father to an amazing 5 year old boy, who is absolutely my mini-me.  When I am not working, I can most often be found with my son on our bikes.  We can be found at the local BMX track, pump track, or riding some of the many trails in the area.</p>
